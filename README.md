# 🪨📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors (Python Game)

An interactive **Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where you can play against different types of AI players — from random to strategic ones.  

This project demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism in Python.

---

## Game Overview
This program lets you play a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against a computer opponent. 

It supports multiple player types, including ones that make random moves, reflect your last move, or cycle through moves.

At the end of three rounds, the program declares the overall winner based on scores.

## Features
- 👩‍💻 Play interactively against the computer  
- 🤖 Choose between multiple AI player types:
  - **RockPlayer** – always chooses rock  
  - **RandomPlayer** – chooses moves randomly  
  - **ReflectPlayer** – copies your previous move  
  - **CyclePlayer** – cycles through rock, paper, scissors  
- 🧮 Score tracking for both players  
- 🕹️ Best of 3 rounds gameplay  
- 🧩 Demonstrates Python’s OOP principles  

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
  - `random` — to generate random moves  
  - `input()` — for interactive player choices
